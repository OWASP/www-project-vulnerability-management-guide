## OWASP VMG TriCycle

![Cycle Image](assets/images/cycle_frames_v2.gif)

---
Failures of vulnerability management programs are likely to result from failures of implementation caused by the common misconception that a working security scanner equals managing vulnerabilities in IT environments. 

Vulnerability management cannot be outsourced to a single tool or even a set of very good tools that would seamlessly orchestrate a process around “some findings” and “some patches”. 

The processes described in the guide involve decision making based on risk practices adopted by your organization. The guide will help you to ask the right questions, if you are tasked to roll out a vulnerability management program on behalf of your information security office. If you are a manager or CISO, the guide should outline how a vulnerability management program can be integrated into your organization.  

Regardless of your role, the purpose of the OWASP Vulnerability Management Guide is to explain how continuous and complex processes can be broken down to the three essential parts, which we call cycles.
