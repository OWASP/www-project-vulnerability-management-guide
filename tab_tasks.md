### Join the cause

The simplest way to contribute to the OWASP Vulnerability Management Guide project is adopting it! 

Please read the [Guide](OWASP-Vuln-Mgm-Guide-Jun01-2020.pdf) and use ["request feature"](https://github.com/lizfrenz/owasp-vuln-mngmnt/issues) to ask your questions or something that would benefit you to speed up the implementation.
Fork away the OVMG on [GitHub](https://github.com/lizfrenz/owasp-vuln-mngmnt).

### How to collaborate

Please use the GitHub [issue](https://github.com/lizfrenz/owasp-vuln-mngmnt/issues) to post your ideas. OWASP is a highly dispersed team of InfoSec/IT professionals. Let's utilize asynchronous communications to move OVMG along. Fill out the questionnaire in the **Feature Request** template by replacing the text in grey with your answers:

* Can you implement OWASP Vulnerability Management Guide at your place of work or business?

` Please state "yes" or "no' and explain why. E.g.: "not applicable", "I don't work in InfoSec", "too complicating". [...]`

* Is your feature request related to the OWASP VMG implementation? Please explain how.

` A clear and concise explanation of what the problem your request solves. [...]`

* Please describe which of VMG cycles would host your addition? Detection, Reporting, Remediation.

` A clear and concise description how what you suggest could be plugged into the existing doc. [...]`

* Describe alternatives you've considered

` A clear and concise description why alternative would NOT work.[...]`

* Did you read the OWASP VMG? What are your thoughts

` Your honest answer goes here.[...]`
