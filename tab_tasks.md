### Join the cause

The simplest way to contribute to the OWASP Vulnerability Management Guide project is publicizing it! 

Please read the “bare bones” [Guide](owasp-vuln-mngm-guide-v1.txt) and use ["report bug" or "request feature"](https://github.com/lizfrenz/owasp-vuln-mngmnt/issues) to ask your questions and request the form of manual (a PowerPoint, a diagram, a hundred pages write up e.g.) that would benefit you the most and speed up the adoption rate.

If you'd like to become a collaborator, please contact me on LinkedIn specifying where you found out about me and list your GitHub name and/or email address connected to your GitHub account.

For collaborators - when you join, please use the GitHub project page to post your ideas. There is a highly dispersed team of InfoSec/IT professionals that expressed interest in working with me on this project. As much as I would like to hold a conference call for OVMG-WG, we need to utilize asynchronous communications tools to move this project along.

:red_circle: Important! You must adhere to the [OWASP Code of Conduct](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct).

### Responsible Disclosure
I might be slow :floppy_disk: or sometimes very slow :space_invader: to respond due to the full-time job, continuous professional development, loving family and friends, and COVID-19:mask:, which I contracted :worried: :worried: :worried:from my husband who works in a hospital. :bulb: Please check out his [OWASP Anti-Ransomware Guide project](https://owasp.org/www-project-anti-ransomware-guide/migrated_content) and [OWASP Secure Medical Device Deployment standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-medical-device-deployment-standard/migrated_content).
