2.2.5	Draw out the trends by count and percentage utilizing KPI that matter to your enterprise risks and 
compliance

increase

2.3	Log Confirmed Findings
2.3.1	Use your organization?s ticketing system
2.3.2	Provide a summary of the issue
2.3.3	Provide tools? based output 
2.3.4	Notify/assign the issue/ticket to the responsible teams or individuals

2.4	Create Reports
2.4.1	Maintain a consistent frequency of reporting and use it to track the changes
2.4.2	Aggregate and process collected data 
2.4.3	Using CVSS, apply unique environmental traits to your vulnerability analysis
2.4.4	State vulnerability trends
2.4.5	Hypothesize about these trends in one sentence
2.4.6	In one paragraph, add your recommendations
2.4.7	Apply data sensitivity classification to your report
2.4.8	Make a shorter version (1-2 pages) of your report
2.4.9	Submit both versions of the report to your manager/CISO
2.4.10	Create and maintain your own vulnerability management repository for internal or external audit
2.4.11	Be able to explain the details of the vulnerability detection and reporting process

3	Remediation Cycle

3.1	Prioritize Vulnerabilities
3.1.1	Use your reports
3.1.2	Use your trend analysis 
3.1.3	Use information from additional sources
3.1.4	Apply other environmental factors
3.1.5	Communicate to responsible and accountable stakeholders

3.2	Patching
3.2.1	Find the stakeholders responsible for patching
